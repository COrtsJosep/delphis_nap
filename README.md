Delphi's Nap (a creative transformation from _the fin app_) is a very boring piece of Rust software that helps you keep track of your personal finances in a way that is neither oversimplified nor time-consuming.

## Description

There are four things that you can do with delphis_nap:
1. Enter new transactions;
2. Produce summaries of your financial situation; 
3. Plot the temporal evolution of your expenses and assets; and
4. Browse through past entered transactions.

delphis_nap additionally supports:
- Entries in different currencies;
- Linking transactions to accounts;
- Linking transactions to firms and businesses;
- Modifying previously entered transactions.
